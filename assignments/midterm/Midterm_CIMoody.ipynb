    "The data is in `dat/online_shoppers_intention.csv.gz`, from [Online Shoppers Purchasing Intention Dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Online+Shoppers+Purchasing+Intention+Dataset)\n",
    "\n",
    "- The dataset consists of 10 numerical and 8 categorical variables.\n",
    "- Variable `Revenue` is the target label. This binary variable is imbalanced, specifically 84.5% of user journeys did NOT result in a purchase; in other words `Revenue` is False.\n",
    "- `Administrative`, `Administrative Duration`, `Informational`, `Informational Duration`, `Product Related`, and `Product Related Duration` represent the number of different types of pages visited by the visitor in that session and total time spent in each of these page categories. \n",
    "- The values of these features are derived from the URL information of the pages visited by the user and updated when a user takes an action, e.g, moving from one page to another. \n",
    "- Features `Bounce Rate`, `Exit Rate` and `Page Value` represent  metrics measured by Google Analytics for each page in the e-commerce site. \n",
    "- The value of `Bounce Rate` for a web page refers to the percentage of visitors who enter the site from that page and then leave (i.e., bounce) without triggering any other requests to the analytics server during that session. \n",
    "- The value of `Exit Rate` for a specific web page is calculated as for all page views to the page and it represents the percentage that the page was seen in the last session. \n",
    "- Feature `Page Value` represents the average value for a web page that a user visited before completing an e-commerce transaction. \n",
    "- Feature `Special Day` indicates the closeness of the site visiting time to a specific special day (e.g., Mother’s Day or Valentine's Day) in which the sessions are more likely to be finalized with transaction. The value of this attribute is determined by considering the dynamics of e-commerce such as the duration between the order date and delivery date. \n",
    "- The dataset also includes operating system, browser, region, traffic type, visitor type as returning or new visitor, a boolean value indicating whether the date of the visit is weekend, and month of the year."
